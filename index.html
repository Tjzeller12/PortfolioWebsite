          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for creating and learning. I'm currently studing Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas.

          <ul>
            <li>Snake Battle Royal
              <ul>
                <li>Snake Battle Royale is an engaging game where players control a snake, aiming to outlast 60 AI-driven snakes. Each AI snake operates on its neural network, developed using the genetic algorithm to enhance their survival strategies.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Integral Calculator</li>
              <ul>
                <li> The Integral Calculator is a tool I designed to compute both definite and indefinite integrals. It utilizes a binary search tree to organize mathematical terms by their degree, ensuring efficient computation and user-friendly interaction.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Monkey Species Classification CNN</li>
              <ul>
                <li> This project involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify 10 different species of monkeys. I built and trained a custom neural network using TensorFlow, leveraging the "10-monkey-species" dataset from Kaggle. The performance of my model was benchmarked against a pre-trained VGG16 model to gauge its effectiveness.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Calculator</li>
              <ul>
                <li> In collaboration with three classmates, I developed a multifunctional calculator capable of performing PEDMAS operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). This project was implemented in Java using AWT and Swing frameworks, highlighting our focus on creating a robust and user-friendly application.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Super Mario Baseball</li>
              <ul>
                <li> Super Mario Baseball is a creative project from my Object-Oriented Programming class. It features a hash map to dynamically update stats for various Mario-themed baseball players, display each player's name and statistics, and list the top performers in each statistical category.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          <p> These projects are showcased on my GitHub profile.</p>
